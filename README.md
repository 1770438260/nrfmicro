# HHKB-BLE

This is an expiremantal HHKB-BLE branch with an extra mosfet.

I had to use TopoR because it's pretty cluttered and I don't want 4-layer PCBs.

## WARINING!

There is a couple of unrouted traces so don't order these boards!

It's not finished and it does NOT work (maybe it will never work).
